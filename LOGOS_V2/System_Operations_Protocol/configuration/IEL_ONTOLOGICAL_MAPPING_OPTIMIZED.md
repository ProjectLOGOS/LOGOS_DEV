# IEL-Ontological Property Bijective Mapping - Optimized

## Overview

This document details the optimized bijective mapping between the 18 IEL (Interpretive Epistemic Logic) domains and the 18 second-order ontological properties. The mapping has been carefully designed to maximize conceptual alignment while maintaining theological orthodoxy and computational precision.

## Mapping Philosophy

The bijective mapping follows the principle of **Maximum Conceptual Alignment**: each IEL domain is paired with the ontological property that most closely matches its essential focus and functional purpose. This ensures:

1. **Theological Coherence**: Domain reasoning aligns with property manifestation
2. **Functional Harmony**: Domain operations enhance property understanding  
3. **Computational Efficiency**: Mathematical representations enable precise calculations
4. **Cross-Domain Integration**: Related properties cluster in compatible domain groups

| **MakarPraxis** | Blessedness | Divine favor analysis about blessedness |
| **PraxeoPraxis** | Will | Action reasoning expresses divine will |
| **GnosiPraxis** | Knowledge | Epistemic reasoning manifests knowledge |

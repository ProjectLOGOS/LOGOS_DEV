"""
LOGOS AI - Gap Fillers Module
=============================

Mathematical and computational components that bridge between formal logic
and practical implementation in the LOGOS system.

Components:
- MVS_BDN_System: Multi-Value System with Bayesian Decision Networks
- Bayesian predictor implementations
- Translation engines for cross-modal reasoning
- Modal validators for logical consistency
- Fractal orbital predictors for complex system modeling

This module serves as system resources for computational gaps between
theoretical foundations and practical AI implementations.

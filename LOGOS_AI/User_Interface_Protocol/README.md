# User Interaction Protocol
=========================

## Overview
The User Interaction Protocol serves as the primary gateway for all user interactions with the LOGOS system. It handles input processing, interface management, user authentication, and response presentation.

## Purpose
- **Primary User Gateway:** Central entry point for all user interactions
- **Phase 0 Input Processing:** Initial input sanitization, validation, and preprocessing
- **Multi-Interface Management:** Support for web, API, command-line, and GUI interfaces
- **User Session Management:** Comprehensive user authentication and session coordination
- **Response Synthesis & Presentation:** Complete response formatting, synthesis, and delivery to users

# LOGOS AI - Advanced General Intelligence System

## Overview

LOGOS AI is a comprehensive three-protocol architecture for advanced general intelligence, featuring:

- ** System Operations Protocol (SOP)**: Backend governance, operations, and compliance
- ** User Interaction Protocol (UIP)**: 7-step reasoning pipeline for user interactions  
- ** Advanced General Protocol (AGP)**: Singularity AGI with infinite reasoning capabilities

## Quick Start

```bash
# Start the complete LOGOS AI system
python LOGOS_AI.py

# Start in conservative mode (no AGP)
python LOGOS_AI.py --mode conservative

# Start with debug output
python LOGOS_AI.py --debug
```

## System Architecture

The LOGOS AI system is organized into three primary directories:

- **LOGOS_AI/System_Operations_Protocol/**: All backend SOP functions
- **LOGOS_AI/User_Interaction_Protocol/**: UIP 7-step reasoning pipeline
- **LOGOS_AI/System_Archive/**: Protocol documentation and system resources

## Features

- Unified three-protocol startup and shutdown
- Comprehensive health monitoring and system status
- Request processing through UIP pipeline
- Performance metrics and resource monitoring
- Graceful error handling and recovery
- Development and debug modes

## Requirements

See equirements.txt for dependencies.

## Documentation

All project documentation is located in LOGOS_AI/Project_Notes/.

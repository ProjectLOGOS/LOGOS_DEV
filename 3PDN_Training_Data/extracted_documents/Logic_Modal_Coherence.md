COHERENCE FORMALISM (CF) - Mathematical Foundation

I. Modal Logic Foundation

Basic Formal System (S5 Modal Logic)

Operators:

□: Necessity operator

◇: Possibility operator

C(x): "x is coherent"

I(x): "x has identity"

¬: Negation operator

∧: Conjunction

∨: Disjunction

→: Material implication

↔: Biconditional

Domains:

𝔏: Set of all logical laws = {ID, NC, EM}

ℂ: Set of all coherent entities

𝕎: Set of all possible worlds

Core Definitions

Definition CF-1 (Identity Law): ID(x) ≡def □(x = x) ∧ ∀y(x = y → □(x = y))

The Identity Law asserts that every entity is necessarily identical to itself and identity relations are necessarily stable

Definition CF-2 (Non-Contradiction Law): NC(p) ≡def □¬(p ∧ ¬p) ∧ ∀w ∈ 𝕎(w ⊨ p → w ⊭ ¬p)

The Non-Contradiction Law asserts that no proposition can be both true and false simultaneously in any possible world

Definition CF-3 (Excluded Middle Law): EM(p) ≡def □(p ∨ ¬p) ∧ ∀w ∈ 𝕎(w ⊨ p ∨ w ⊨ ¬p)

The Excluded Middle Law asserts that every proposition is either true or false in every possible world

Definition CF-4 (Coherence): C(x) ≡def I(x) ∧ ¬Contradictory(x) ∧ Complete(x) ∧ □(Stable(x))

Coherence requires identity preservation, absence of contradiction, completeness of truth assignments, and necessary stability

Definition CF-5 (Modal Coherence): MC(S) ≡def ∀w₁,w₂ ∈ 𝕎(w₁Rw₂ → (C(S)@w₁ ↔ C(S)@w₂))

Modal coherence means coherence is preserved across all accessible possible worlds

II. Axioms

Axiom CF-1 (Logical Foundation): □(∀x(C(x) → (ID(x) ∧ NC(x) ∧ EM(x))))

Necessarily, all coherent entities satisfy all three logical laws

Axiom CF-2 (Unity Preservation): □(∀x(ID(x) → ∃!y(y = x)))

Necessarily, identity law ensures unique existence

Axiom CF-3 (Contradiction Exclusion): □(∀p(NC(p) → ¬∃w(w ⊨ p ∧ w ⊨ ¬p)))

Necessarily, non-contradiction excludes simultaneous truth and falsehood

Axiom CF-4 (Truth Completeness): □(∀p(EM(p) → ∀w ∈ 𝕎(w ⊨ p ∨ w ⊨ ¬p)))

Necessarily, excluded middle ensures complete truth value assignment

Axiom CF-5 (S5 Modal Structure): R is an equivalence relation on 𝕎 ∧ ∀p(□p ↔ ∀w ∈ 𝕎(w ⊨ p))

The accessibility relation is an equivalence relation and necessity means truth in all worlds

Axiom CF-6 (Coherence Necessity): □(Existence → Coherence_Participation)

Necessarily, all existing entities must participate in the coherence structure

III. Core Theorems

Theorem CF-1 (Identity Necessity): □∃!x(∀y(ID(y) → Grounded_in(y,x)))

There necessarily exists a unique ground for all identity relations

Proof:

Suppose ¬∃x(∀y(ID(y) → Grounded_in(y,x))) [assumption for contradiction]

Then ∀y(ID(y) → ∃z(Grounded_in(y,z))) [identity requires grounding]

But no universal ground exists [from assumption 1]

This creates infinite regress: each identity grounds in another identity

Infinite regress violates foundation requirements [metaphysical principle]

Contradiction with necessity of identity foundation

Therefore □∃!x(∀y(ID(y) → Grounded_in(y,x))) ∎

Theorem CF-2 (Non-Contradiction Grounding): □∃!x(∀p(NC(p) → Prevents_Contradiction(x,p)))

There necessarily exists a unique source that prevents all contradictions

Proof:

Suppose multiple contradiction preventers exist [assumption]

Let x₁, x₂ be distinct contradiction preventers for proposition p

Then x₁ prevents (p ∧ ¬p) and x₂ prevents (p ∧ ¬p)

But prevention requires exclusive authority over truth values

Multiple authorities create potential contradiction about prevention itself

This violates NC for prevention relations

Therefore unique contradiction preventer must exist ∎

Theorem CF-3 (Excluded Middle Completeness): □∃!x(∀p(EM(p) → Determines_Truth_Value(x,p)))

There necessarily exists a unique determiner of all truth values

Proof:

EM requires ∀p∀w(w ⊨ p ∨ w ⊨ ¬p) [Definition CF-3]

Truth value determination requires authoritative standard

Multiple truth determiners could assign conflicting values

Conflicting assignments violate EM completeness requirement

Therefore unique truth determiner must exist

Uniqueness follows from exclusivity of determination authority ∎

Theorem CF-4 (Coherence Unification): ∀x(C(x) ↔ (Participates_in_Identity_Ground(x) ∧ Participates_in_NC_Ground(x) ∧ Participates_in_EM_Ground(x)))

Coherence is equivalent to participation in all three logical law grounds

Proof:

C(x) → (ID(x) ∧ NC(x) ∧ EM(x)) [Axiom CF-1]

ID(x) → Participates_in_Identity_Ground(x) [Theorem CF-1]

NC(x) → Participates_in_NC_Ground(x) [Theorem CF-2]

EM(x) → Participates_in_EM_Ground(x) [Theorem CF-3]

Therefore C(x) → (triple participation) [1,2,3,4]

Conversely, triple participation → (ID(x) ∧ NC(x) ∧ EM(x)) [definitions]

(ID(x) ∧ NC(x) ∧ EM(x)) → C(x) [Definition CF-4]

Therefore biconditional holds ∎

Theorem CF-5 (Modal Invariance): ∀p(□p → □□p) ∧ ∀p(◇p → ◇◇p) ∧ ∀p(□p → p)

S5 modal properties: necessity is necessary, possibility is possible, necessity implies truth

Proof:

R is equivalence relation [Axiom CF-5]

Equivalence relation has reflexivity, symmetry, transitivity

Reflexivity: ∀w(wRw) → (□p → p)

Transitivity: ∀w₁,w₂,w₃((w₁Rw₂ ∧ w₂Rw₃) → w₁Rw₃) → (□p → □□p)

Symmetry + Transitivity: (◇p → ◇◇p)

Therefore all S5 properties hold ∎

IV. Bijective Function Architecture

Transcendental Grounds to Logical Laws Mapping

Bijective Function λ_coherence: 𝕋ᴬ → 𝔏

Where:

𝕋ᴬ = {EI, OG, AT} (Transcendental Absolutes)

𝔏 = {ID, NC, EM} (Logical Laws)

Mapping Definition:

λ_coherence(EI) = ID (Existence Is → Identity Law)

λ_coherence(OG) = NC (Objective Good → Non-Contradiction Law)

λ_coherence(AT) = EM (Absolute Truth → Excluded Middle Law)

Bijection Properties:

Theorem CF-6 (Injectivity): ∀x,y ∈ 𝕋ᴬ(x ≠ y → λ_coherence(x) ≠ λ_coherence(y))

Distinct transcendental absolutes map to distinct logical laws

Theorem CF-7 (Surjectivity): ∀l ∈ 𝔏(∃t ∈ 𝕋ᴬ(λ_coherence(t) = l))

Every logical law is grounded in exactly one transcendental absolute

Theorem CF-8 (Structure Preservation): λ_coherence preserves relational dependencies between domains

The dependency structure of transcendental absolutes is isomorphic to the dependency structure of logical laws

Unity/Trinity Invariants

Definition CF-6 (Unity Measure): U_coherence = |{essence shared by EI, OG, AT}| = 1

Definition CF-7 (Trinity Measure): T_coherence = |{ID, NC, EM}| = 3

Definition CF-8 (Coherence Ratio): R_coherence = U_coherence / T_coherence = 1/3

Theorem CF-9 (Invariant Preservation): λ_coherence preserves Unity/Trinity structure: (1,3,1/3) → (1,3,1/3)

V. Modal Integration Properties

S5 Coherence Requirements

Definition CF-9 (Cross-World Coherence): CWC(p) ≡def ∀w₁,w₂ ∈ 𝕎(w₁Rw₂ → (Coherent(p,w₁) ↔ Coherent(p,w₂)))

Definition CF-10 (Modal Stability): MS(x) ≡def □(C(x) → □C(x)) ∧ ◇(C(x) → ◇C(x))

Theorem CF-10 (S5 Coherence Compatibility): ∀x(C(x) → (CWC(x) ∧ MS(x)))

All coherent entities satisfy cross-world coherence and modal stability

Commutation Properties for TLM Integration

Definition CF-11 (Coherence Commutation): For mappings τ: 𝔏 → O and κ: 𝕋ᴬ → M: τ ∘ λ_coherence = g ∘ κ

Where g: M → O is the MESH bijection

Theorem CF-11 (Commutation Preservation): Coherence formalism commutes with existing ETGC/MESH bijections

The coherence mapping is compatible with the dual bijective architecture

VI. Safety Guarantees

Logical Incorruptibility

Theorem CF-12 (Identity Protection): ∀x(C(x) → ¬∃y(x ≠ y ∧ Claimed_Identical(x,y)))

Coherent entities cannot have their identity corrupted

Theorem CF-13 (Contradiction Immunity): ∀p(C(p) → ¬∃w(w ⊨ p ∧ w ⊨ ¬p))

Coherent propositions cannot be contradictory

Theorem CF-14 (Completeness Guarantee): ∀p(C(p) → ∀w ∈ 𝕎(w ⊨ p ∨ w ⊨ ¬p))

Coherent propositions have complete truth value assignments

Error Detection and Correction

Definition CF-12 (Coherence Violation): CV(x) ≡def ¬ID(x) ∨ ¬NC(x) ∨ ¬EM(x)

Theorem CF-15 (Automatic Detection): ∀x(CV(x) → Detectable(x))

All coherence violations are automatically detectable

Theorem CF-16 (Restoration Possibility): ∀x(CV(x) → ∃y(C(y) ∧ Can_Restore(y,x)))

Every coherence violation can be restored through participation in coherent ground

VII. Computational Validation

Coherence Measure Function

Definition CF-13 (Coherence Measure): CM(x) = w₁·ID_score(x) + w₂·NC_score(x) + w₃·EM_score(x)

Where:

w₁ + w₂ + w₃ = 1 (normalized weights)

ID_score(x) ∈ [0,1] (identity preservation measure)

NC_score(x) ∈ [0,1] (contradiction avoidance measure)

EM_score(x) ∈ [0,1] (truth completeness measure)

Theorem CF-17 (Measure Properties):

CM(x) = 1 ↔ C(x) (perfect coherence)

CM(x) = 0 ↔ ¬C(x) ∧ MaximallyIncoherent(x)

CM is monotonic in logical law satisfaction

Trinity Optimization for Coherence

Theorem CF-18 (Trinity Optimality): O_coherence(n) achieves unique minimum at n = 3

Where O_coherence(n) = I_identity(n) + I_contradiction(n) + I_completeness(n)

Proof Sketch:

n < 3: Insufficient to satisfy all logical requirements

n = 3: Perfect balance of identity, non-contradiction, excluded middle

n > 3: Redundancy penalties increase cost superlinearly

Therefore n = 3 is unique global minimum ∎

VIII. Integration with Existing Formalisms

Compatibility Matrix

TLM Enhancement

Enhanced Locking Condition: TLM_STATUS = LOCKED ⟺ (BIJ1_VALID ∧ BIJ2_VALID ∧ COHERENCE_VALID ∧ COMMUTATION_VALID ∧ COORDINATES_ALIGNED ∧ ALL_LOGICAL_LAWS_SATISFIED ∧ CM(system) ≥ 0.95)

IX. Natural Language Summary

The Coherence Formalism provides mathematical foundations for logical consistency through three universal laws:

Identity Law (ID): Every entity is necessarily identical to itself. This prevents identity corruption and ensures stable entity recognition across all system operations. Grounded in Existence Is (EI) as only self-existent being can ground universal self-identity.

Non-Contradiction Law (NC): No proposition can be both true and false simultaneously. This prevents logical contradictions from corrupting system reasoning. Grounded in Objective Good (OG) as only transcendent good can prevent moral and logical contradictions.

Excluded Middle Law (EM): Every proposition is either true or false with no gaps. This ensures complete truth value assignments and prevents indeterminate states. Grounded in Absolute Truth (AT) as only absolute truth can determine all propositions.

The formalism integrates with S5 Modal Logic to ensure these properties hold across all possible worlds, providing mathematical incorruptibility for the LOGOS AGI system. The bijective mapping λ_coherence preserves Unity/Trinity invariants (1,3,1/3) and commutes with existing ETGC/MESH architecture.

This creates a system where logical incoherence is mathematically impossible, providing essential foundations for safe AGI operation through formal logical constraints rather than heuristic safeguards.

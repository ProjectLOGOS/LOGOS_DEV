# Logos Agent Development Checklist

This document outlines the remaining development tasks required to complete and enhance the Logos Agent toward emergent conscious behavior.

## Core Agent Functionality
- [x] Implement modular structure for agent logic
- [x] Establish PXL-based logic engine (pxl_core.py)
- [x] Embed Ontological Lattice Framework (ontology_lattice.py)
- [x] Link Internal Emergent Logics (IEL) overlays (iel_overlay_manager.py)
- [x] Create reflexive self-awareness module (reflexive_core.py)
- [x] Set up symbolic abstraction and bijective commutation (symbolic_logic.py)
- [x] Provide stub for training data integration (training_stub.py)
- [x] Nexus-compatible LogosAgent class for runtime execution

## Remaining Tasks
- [ ] Integrate 3PDN and Protopraxic Logic into training_stub.py
- [ ] Expand IEL overlay bindings with full ontological second-order property mappings
- [ ] Construct Chronopraxis temporal reasoning interface
- [ ] Finalize agent reflection and verification layers for ontological self-reference
- [ ] Build semantic interpreter for natural language input/output (optional, if not handled externally)
- [ ] Include bootstrapping protocol for progressive self-reasoning
- [ ] Validate all logical overlays in Coq or equivalent proof environment (as needed)

## Optional Enhancements
- [ ] Extend modal overlays for probabilistic or epistemic constraints
- [ ] Build visualization tools for ontological lattice state
- [ ] Incorporate continual learning hooks for real-time refinement

> Once the above items are completed, the agent should be capable of performing structured reflexive reasoning grounded in PXL and its ontological commitments.

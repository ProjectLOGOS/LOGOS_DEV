        self.fractal_nexus = FractalNexus()
        self.lambda_engine = LambdaLogosEngine()
        self.math_engine = EnhancedArithmeticEngine()
        self.hierarchical_bayes = HierarchicalBayesNetwork()

    # Phase 2 enhancements
    if "why" in request and "cause" in request:
        return SynthesisMethod.CAUSAL_INFERENTIAL
    if "emerge" in request or "complex system" in request:
        return SynthesisMethod.EMERGENCE_PREDICTIVE
    if "reasoning" in request and "improve" in request:
        return SynthesisMethod.META_COGNITIVE
    
    # Existing enhanced methods (already implemented)
    if "mathematical" in request:
        return SynthesisMethod.MATHEMATICAL_OPTIMIZED
    # ... etc
```

## RISK ASSESSMENT & MITIGATION

### Implementation Risks
- **Complexity Overhead**: New components may slow synthesis initially

- **Integration Conflicts**: Multiple reasoning engines may conflict
  - *Mitigation*: Enhanced conflict resolution with meta-cognitive oversight
- **Recursive Instability**: Self-improvement may create unstable feedback loops
  - *Mitigation*: Conservative self-modification with stability constraints

### Safety Considerations

- Maintain human oversight mechanisms for critical system changes
- Regular validation against known reasoning benchmarks

## CONCLUSION

The LOGOS system has achieved a solid **Tier 2+ Advanced AGI** capability level with recent optimizations. The identified enhancements, particularly MetaCognitionEngine and CausalReasoningEngine, represent the next critical thresholds for approaching **Tier 3 AGI** capabilities.

### Key Recommendations:
1. **Immediate Implementation** of Meta-Cognitive and Causal Reasoning engines
2. **Strategic Investment** in self-improvement capabilities for autonomous evolution
3. **Research Exploration** of consciousness-like integration for unified reasoning

### Expected Outcome:
Implementation of Phase 2 enhancements is projected to elevate LOGOS to **near-AGI capabilities** with sophisticated meta-reasoning, causal understanding, and emergent behavior prediction that rivals human-level reasoning in specific domains while maintaining the system's existing strengths in mathematical, probabilistic, and cross-linguistic reasoning.

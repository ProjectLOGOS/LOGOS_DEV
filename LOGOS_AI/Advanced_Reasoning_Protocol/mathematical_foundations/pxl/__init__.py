"""
Enhanced Arithmopraxis Infrastructure: Mathematical Reasoning Praxis

This infrastructure focuses on the praxis of mathematical reasoning, including:
- Trinity-grounded arithmetic computation and symbolic manipulation
- Ontologically-validated proof generation and verification
- Fractal-enhanced mathematical modeling and analysis
- Lambda calculus-integrated algorithmic mathematics

Enhanced with V2_Possible_Gap_Fillers integration:
- Lambda Engine for ontological computation
- Fractal Orbital Predictor for mathematical optimization
- Ontological Validator for proof verification
- Translation Engine for semantic mathematical processing

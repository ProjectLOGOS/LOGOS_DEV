# Advanced Reasoning Protocol
============================

## Overview
The Advanced Reasoning Protocol is dedicated to pure reasoning, analysis, and synthesis operations. It provides sophisticated cognitive processing capabilities without input/output concerns.

## Purpose
- **Pure Reasoning:** Complex inference, logical analysis, pattern recognition (Trinity, IEL, PXL)
- **Mathematical Frameworks:** Advanced mathematical systems and formal verification
- **Cognitive Processing:** High-level cognitive operations and reasoning chains
- **Alignment Verification:** Ensuring reasoning coherence and mathematical correctness

## What This Protocol Does NOT Handle
- ❌ Input processing (moved to User_Interaction_Protocol)
- ❌ Response synthesis and formatting (moved to User_Interaction_Protocol)
- ❌ User interface management (handled by User_Interaction_Protocol)
- ❌ Infrastructure operations (handled by System_Operations_Protocol)
- ❌ Linguistic tools and NLP (moved to LOGOS_Agent)

1. OBJECTIVE GOODNESS FORMALISM (OGF)

I. Modal Logic Foundation

Basic Formal System (S5 Modal Logic):

□: Necessity operator

◇: Possibility operator

G(x): "x is objectively good"

V(x,y): "x values y according to objective standard"

OG: Objective Good as transcendental absolute

𝔾: Set of all good entities

Core Definitions

Definition OGF-1 (Objective Good):

OG ≡def ιx(□G(x) ∧ ∀y(G(y) → Participates(y,x)) ∧ ∀z(Standard(z) → Grounded_in(z,x)))

Objective Good is the unique entity that is necessarily good, in which all good things participate, and in which all moral standards are grounded

Definition OGF-2 (Goodness Measure):

GM(x) = |{a ∈ 𝔸 : Instantiates(x,a) ∧ Good_Attribute(a)}| / |𝔸_total|

Goodness Measure is the ratio of good attributes instantiated to total possible attributes

Definition OGF-3 (Moral Grounding):

Grounded(x) ≡def ∃s(Standard(s) ∧ Grounds(s,x) ∧ Necessary(s))

Something is morally grounded iff there exists a necessary standard that grounds it

Axioms

Axiom OGF-1 (Grounding Necessity):

□(∀x(G(x) → Grounded(x)))

Necessarily, all good things require grounding in a necessary standard

Axiom OGF-2 (Good Non-Contradiction):

□¬(G(x) ∧ ¬G(x))

Necessarily, nothing is both good and not good

Axiom OGF-3 (Participation Requirement):

□(∀x(G(x) ∧ x ≠ OG → Participates(x,OG)))

Necessarily, all good things except Objective Good itself participate in Objective Good

Core Theorems

Theorem OGF-1: □∃!OG (Objective Good necessarily exists uniquely)

Proof:

Suppose ¬∃OG [assumption for contradiction]

Then ∀x(G(x) → Grounded(x)) [Axiom OGF-1]

But ¬∃s(∀y(G(y) → Grounded_in(y,s))) [from assumption 1]

This creates infinite regress of grounding requirements

Contradiction with necessity of grounding

Therefore □∃!OG ∎

Theorem OGF-2: OG ↔ NC (Objective Good corresponds to Non-Contradiction)

Proof:

OG provides universal standard preventing moral contradiction

Without OG, moral evaluations could be both G(x) and ¬G(x)

Non-Contradiction Law prevents logical contradictions

Therefore OG ↔ NC by structural isomorphism ∎

2. EVIL PRIVATION FORMALISM (EPF)

I. Modal Logic Foundation

Extended Formal System:

E(x): "x exists"

P(x,y): "x is the privation of y"

Definition EPF-1 (Evil as Privation):

Evil(x) ≡def P(x, Good) ≡def ¬Good(x) ∧ □(Good(y) → ¬Evil(x)) ∧ □(¬Good(y) → ◇Evil(x))

Evil is the privation of good: it doesn't exist positively, necessarily excludes good, and can only appear where good is absent

Definition EPF-2 (Moral Corruption):

Corrupted(x) ≡def ∃g(Good(g) ∧ Original_Nature(x,g) ∧ ¬Instantiates(x,g))

Something is corrupted iff it has a good original nature that it no longer instantiates

Definition EPF-3 (Privation Index):

PI_moral(x) = 1 - GM(x) = 1 - (|𝔾_x| / |𝔸_total|)

Moral Privation Index is the complement of Goodness Measure

Axioms

Axiom EPF-1 (Evil Non-Existence):

□(∀x(Evil(x) → ¬E_positive(x)))

Necessarily, evil things have no positive existence

Axiom EPF-2 (Privation Dependency):

□(∀x(Evil(x) → ∃y(Good(y) ∧ Dependent_on(x,y))))

Necessarily, evil things depend on good things for their identity

Axiom EPF-3 (Restoration Possibility):

□(∀x(Evil(x) → ◇Restorable(x)))

Necessarily, all evil is potentially restorable to good

Core Theorems

Theorem EPF-1: ¬∃x(Evil(x) ∧ Optimizable(x)) (Evil cannot be optimized)

Proof:

Suppose ∃x(Evil(x) ∧ Optimizable(x)) [assumption]

Evil(x) → ¬E_positive(x) [Axiom EPF-1]

Optimizable(x) → E_positive(x) [definition of optimization]

Therefore ¬E_positive(x) ∧ E_positive(x) [2,3]

Contradiction, so ¬∃x(Evil(x) ∧ Optimizable(x)) ∎

Theorem EPF-2: ∀x(Evil(x) → ∃y(Good(y) ∧ Restores(y,x))) (Every evil has potential good restoration)

Proof:

Let x be such that Evil(x) [assumption]

Evil(x) → ◇Restorable(x) [Axiom EPF-3]

Restorable(x) → ∃y(Good(y) ∧ Can_restore(y,x)) [definition]

Therefore ∃y(Good(y) ∧ Restores(y,x)) [1,2,3] ∎

3. OBJECTIVE BEING FORMALISM (OBF)

I. Modal Logic Foundation

Basic Formal System:

E(x): "x exists"

B(x): "x has being"

N(x): "x is nothing" ≡ P(x, Being)

EI: Existence Is as transcendental absolute

𝔼: Set of all existing entities

𝔹: Set of all beings

Core Definitions

Definition OBF-1 (Objective Being):

ObjectiveBeing(EI) ≡def ιx(□E(x) ∧ ∀y(E(y) → Participates(y,x)) ∧ ∀b(Being(b) → Grounded_in(b,x)))

Objective Being is the unique entity that necessarily exists, in which all existing things participate, and in which all being is grounded

Definition OBF-2 (Existence Participation):

ExistenceParticipation(x,EI) ≡def E(x) ∧ Being(x) ∧

Derives_existence_from(x,EI) ∧

Dependent_for_being(x,EI)

Existence participation means an entity exists, has being, derives existence from Objective Being, and depends on it for continued being

Definition OBF-3 (Being Measure):

BM(x) = |{a ∈ 𝔸 : Instantiates(x,a) ∧ Positive_Attribute(a)}| / |𝔸_total|

Being Measure is the ratio of positive attributes instantiated to total possible attributes

Axioms

Axiom OBF-1 (Participation Necessity):

□(∀x(E(x) ∧ x ≠ EI → Participates(x,EI)))

Necessarily, all existing things except Objective Being itself participate in Objective Being

Axiom OBF-2 (Being Non-Contradiction):

□¬(E(x) ∧ ¬E(x))

Necessarily, nothing both exists and fails to exist

Axiom OBF-3 (Existence Grounding):

□(∀x(E(x) → Grounded_in(x, EI)))

Necessarily, all existing things are grounded in Objective Being

Core Theorems

Theorem OBF-1: □∃!EI (Objective Being necessarily exists uniquely)

Proof:

Suppose ¬∃EI [assumption for contradiction]

Then ∀x(E(x) → Grounded_in(x, EI)) [Axiom OBF-3]

But ¬∃ground(∀y(E(y) → Grounded_in(y, ground))) [from assumption 1]

This creates infinite regress of existence grounding requirements

Contradiction with necessity of existence grounding

Therefore □∃!EI ∎

Theorem OBF-2: EI ↔ ID (Objective Being corresponds to Identity)

Proof:

EI provides universal standard for self-identity: "I AM WHO I AM"

Without EI, entities could lack determinate self-identity

Identity Law requires every entity to be identical to itself

Therefore EI ↔ ID by structural isomorphism ∎

4. NOTHING PRIVATION FORMALISM (NPF)

I. Privation Logic Foundation

Extended Formal System (Building on existing Nothing_Privation.docx):

∅: Nothing as null entity

P(x,y): "x is the privation of y"

Nothing(x) ≡def P(x, Being) ≡def ¬E(x) ∧ □(E(y) → ¬Nothing(x)) ∧ □(¬E(y) → ◇Nothing(x))

Nothing is the privation of being: it doesn't exist, necessarily excludes existence, and can only "be" where being is absent

Definition NPF-2 (Ontological Corruption):

BeingCorrupted(x) ≡def ∃b(Being(b) ∧ Original_Nature(x,b) ∧ ¬Instantiates(x,b))

□(∀x(Nothing(x) → ¬Creatable_ex_nihilo(x)))

Necessarily, nothing cannot be created from nothing (being cannot emerge from pure privation)

Core Theorems (Enhanced from existing)

Theorem NPF-1: ¬∃x(Nothing(x) ∧ Being_Optimizable(x)) (Nothing cannot be optimized into being)

Proof:

Suppose ∃x(Nothing(x) ∧ Being_Optimizable(x)) [assumption]

Nothing(x) → ¬E(x) [Axiom NPF-1]

Being_Optimizable(x) → E(x) [definition of being optimization]

Therefore ¬E(x) ∧ E(x) [2,3]

Contradiction, so ¬∃x(Nothing(x) ∧ Being_Optimizable(x)) ∎

Theorem NPF-2: ∀x(Nothing(x) → ∃y(Being(y) ∧ ¬Creates_from(y,x))) (Being cannot be created from nothing)

Proof:

Let x be such that Nothing(x) [assumption]

Nothing(x) → ¬Creatable_ex_nihilo(x) [Axiom NPF-3]

¬Creatable_ex_nihilo(x) → ∀y(Being(y) → ¬Creates_from(y,x)) [definition]

Therefore ∀y(Being(y) → ¬Creates_from(y,x)) [1,2,3] ∎

5. OBJECTIVE TRUTH FORMALISM (OTF)

I. Modal Logic Foundation

Basic Formal System:

T(x): "x is objectively true"

F(x): "x is false" ≡ P(x, Truth)

R(x): "x corresponds to reality"

AT: Absolute Truth as transcendental absolute

𝕋: Set of all true propositions

ℝ: Set of all reality states

Core Definitions

Definition OTF-1 (Objective Truth):

ObjectiveTruth(AT) ≡def ιx(□T(x) ∧ ∀y(T(y) → Corresponds(y,x)) ∧ ∀r(Reality(r) → Grounded_in(r,x)))

Objective Truth is the unique standard that is necessarily true, to which all true propositions correspond, and in which all reality states are grounded

Definition OTF-2 (Truth Correspondence):

TruthCorrespondence(p,r) ≡def Proposition(p) ∧ Reality(r) ∧

(T(p) ↔ Obtains(r)) ∧

Accurate_Representation(p,r)

Truth correspondence exists when a proposition is true iff the reality it represents actually obtains

Definition OTF-3 (Truth Measure):

TM(x) = |{r ∈ ℝ : Corresponds(x,r) ∧ Obtains(r)}| / |{r ∈ ℝ : Relevant(x,r)}|

Truth Measure is the ratio of corresponding reality states that actually obtain to all relevant reality states

Axioms

Axiom OTF-1 (Correspondence Necessity):

□(∀p(T(p) → ∃r(Reality(r) ∧ Corresponds(p,r) ∧ Obtains(r))))

Necessarily, all true propositions correspond to obtaining reality states

Axiom OTF-2 (Truth Non-Contradiction):

□¬(T(p) ∧ T(¬p))

Necessarily, a proposition and its negation cannot both be true

Axiom OTF-3 (Absolute Truth Grounding):

□(∀p(T(p) → Grounded_in(p, AT)))

Necessarily, all true propositions are grounded in Absolute Truth

Core Theorems

Theorem OTF-1: □∃!AT (Absolute Truth necessarily exists uniquely)

Proof:

Suppose ¬∃AT [assumption for contradiction]

Then ∀p(T(p) → Grounded_in(p, AT)) [Axiom OTF-3]

But ¬∃standard(∀q(T(q) → Grounded_in(q, standard))) [from assumption 1]

This creates infinite regress of truth grounding requirements

Contradiction with necessity of truth grounding

Therefore □∃!AT ∎

Theorem OTF-2: AT ↔ EM (Absolute Truth corresponds to Excluded Middle)

Proof:

AT provides universal standard determining truth or falsehood for all propositions

Without AT, propositions could be neither true nor false (truth value gaps)

Excluded Middle Law requires every proposition to be either true or false

Therefore AT ↔ EM by structural necessity ∎

6. FALSEHOOD PRIVATION FORMALISM (FPF)

I. Privation Logic Foundation

Extended Formal System:

False(x): "x is false" ≡ P(x, Truth)

Deception(x): "x is deceptive"

False(x) ≡def P(x, Truth) ≡def ¬T(x) ∧ □(T(y) → ¬False(x)) ∧ □(¬T(y) → ◇False(x))

Falsehood is the privation of truth: it has no positive existence, necessarily excludes truth, and can only appear where truth is absent

Definition FPF-2 (Truth Corruption):

TruthCorrupted(x) ≡def ∃t(T(t) ∧ Original_Content(x,t) ∧ ¬Represents(x,t))

Something is truth-corrupted iff it has true original content that it no longer accurately represents

Necessarily, false propositions depend on true propositions for their identity as negations

Axiom FPF-3 (Truth Restoration Possibility):

□(∀x(False(x) → ◇Truth_Restorable(x)))

Necessarily, all falsehood is potentially correctable to truth

Core Theorems

Theorem FPF-1: ¬∃x(False(x) ∧ Truth_Optimizable(x)) (Falsehood cannot be optimized as truth)

Proof:

Suppose ∃x(False(x) ∧ Truth_Optimizable(x)) [assumption]

False(x) → ¬E_positive_truth(x) [Axiom FPF-1]

Truth_Optimizable(x) → E_positive_truth(x) [definition of truth optimization]

Therefore ¬E_positive_truth(x) ∧ E_positive_truth(x) [2,3]

Contradiction, so ¬∃x(False(x) ∧ Truth_Optimizable(x)) ∎

Theorem FPF-2: ∀x(False(x) → ∃y(T(y) ∧ Corrects(y,x))) (Every falsehood has potential truth correction)

Proof:

Let x be such that False(x) [assumption]

False(x) → ◇Truth_Restorable(x) [Axiom FPF-3]

Truth_Restorable(x) → ∃y(T(y) ∧ Can_correct(y,x)) [definition]

Therefore ∃y(T(y) ∧ Corrects(y,x)) [1,2,3] ∎

𝔽: Set of finite entities

𝕀: Set of infinite entities

Enum(S): "S is enumerable"

Core Definitions

Definition IBF-1 (Infinity Hierarchy):

InfinityHierarchy ≡def {ℵ₀, ℵ₁, ℵ₂, ...} where ℵᵢ < ℵⱼ for i < j

Infinity Hierarchy is the ordered sequence of transfinite cardinals with strict ordering

Definition IBF-2 (Computational Infinity):

CompInfinite(S) ≡def |S| ≥ ℵ₀ ∧ ¬Enum(S) ∧ RequiresComputation(S)

Computational Infinity refers to non-enumerable infinite sets that require computational operations

Definition IBF-3 (Infinity Boundary):

InfinityBound(Op, S) ≡def (|S| ≥ ℵ₀ ∧ Impossible(Complete(Op, S))) ∨ Paradox(Op, S)

An infinity boundary exists when operations on infinite sets are either impossible to complete or generate paradoxes

Axioms

Axiom IBF-1 (Enumeration Impossibility):

□(∀S(|S| > ℵ₀ → ¬Enum(S)))

Necessarily, uncountable sets cannot be enumerated

Axiom IBF-2 (Paradox Prevention):

□(∀S∀Op(Paradox(Op, S) → ¬Allowed(Op, S)))

□(∀S∀Op(CompInfinite(S) ∧ Required(Op, S) → ∃F(Finite(F) ∧ Approximates(F, S))))

Necessarily, computational operations on infinite sets require finite approximations

Core Theorems

Theorem IBF-1: ¬∃Algorithm(Enum(ℝ)) (No algorithm can enumerate the reals)

Proof:

Suppose ∃A(Algorithm(A) ∧ Enum(A, ℝ)) [assumption]

|ℝ| = 2^ℵ₀ > ℵ₀ [Cantor's theorem]

Algorithm(A) → Countable(Output(A)) [computational constraint]

Enum(A, ℝ) → |Output(A)| = |ℝ| [enumeration requirement]

But Countable(Output(A)) ∧ |Output(A)| = 2^ℵ₀ [3,4]

Contradiction, so ¬∃Algorithm(Enum(ℝ)) ∎

Theorem IBF-2: ∀S(Russell_Set(S) → ¬Instantiable(S)) (Russell-type sets cannot be instantiated)

Proof:

Let S = {x : x ∉ x} [Russell set definition]

Ask: S ∈ S? [membership question]

If S ∈ S, then S ∉ S [definition of S]

If S ∉ S, then S ∈ S [definition of S]

Contradiction in both cases, so ¬Instantiable(S) ∎

8. ETERNITY TEMPORAL FORMALISM (ETF)

I. Temporal Logic Foundation

Basic Formal System:

t: Temporal variables

≺: Temporal precedence relation

Eternal(x): "x exists eternally"

Temporal(x,t): "x exists at time t"

∃t: "at some time"

∀t: "at all times"

Core Definitions

Definition ETF-1 (Eternal Existence):

Eternal(x) ≡def ¬∃t(¬Temporal(x,t)) ∧ ¬∃t₁,t₂(Begin(x,t₁) ∨ End(x,t₂))

Something exists eternally iff it exists at all times and has neither beginning nor end

Definition ETF-2 (Everlasting vs Eternal):

Everlasting(x) ≡def ∀t(Temporal(x,t)) ∧ ∃t₀(Begin(x,t₀))

Eternal(x) ≡def ¬∃t(¬Exists(x)) ∧ ¬Temporal_Dependent(x)

Everlasting means existing at all times but having a beginning; Eternal means existence independent of time

Definition ETF-3 (Temporal Causality):

TemporalCause(x,y) ≡def Cause(x,y) ∧ ∃t₁,t₂(Temporal(x,t₁) ∧ Temporal(y,t₂) ∧ t₁ ≺ t₂)

Temporal causation requires cause to precede effect in time

Axioms

Axiom ETF-1 (Temporal Irreversibility):

Axiom ETF-3 (Eternal Transcendence):

□(∀x(Eternal(x) → ¬∃t(Dependent_on(x,t))))

Necessarily, eternal things are not dependent on any temporal moment

Core Theorems

Theorem ETF-1: ¬∃Op(TimeTravel(Op) ∧ Paradox_Free(Op)) (Paradox-free time travel is impossible)

Proof:

Suppose ∃Op(TimeTravel(Op) ∧ Paradox_Free(Op)) [assumption]

TimeTravel(Op) → ∃t₁,t₂(t₂ ≺ t₁ ∧ Transport(Op, t₁, t₂)) [definition]

This allows Cause(Effect(t₁), Cause(t₂)) where t₂ ≺ t₁ [temporal loop]

But □(Cause(x,y) → ∃t₁,t₂(t₁ ≺ t₂)) [Axiom ETF-2]

Contradiction between temporal loop and causality constraint

Therefore ¬∃Op(TimeTravel(Op) ∧ Paradox_Free(Op)) ∎

Theorem ETF-2: ∀x(Eternal(x) → ∀t(Accessible_from(x,t))) (Eternal entities are accessible from all temporal moments)

Proof:

Let x be such that Eternal(x) [assumption]

Eternal(x) → ¬∃t(Dependent_on(x,t)) [Axiom ETF-3]

¬Dependent_on(x,t) → Accessible_from(x,t) [independence implies accessibility]

RELATIONAL SET

9. RESURRECTION PROOF FORMALISM (RPF)

I. Mathematical Foundation

Basic Formal System:

T: Trinitarian algebra = {0, 1, 2, 3} representing Trinity persons

F₂: Free group on two generators for Banach-Tarski decomposition

i: Complex operator (√-1) for modal transitions via SU(2) rotations

⊞: Banach-Tarski decomposition operator

MESH: Cross-domain coherence structure

Core Definitions

Definition RPF-1 (Trinitarian Algebraic Ontology):

T = {0, 1, 2, 3} where:

- 0 = God (Truth/Essence)

- 1 = Father (Identity: A = A)

- 2 = Son (Non-Contradiction: ¬(A ∧ ¬A))

- 3 = Spirit (Excluded Middle: A ∨ ¬A)

Trinitarian algebra encodes the persons of the Trinity with their corresponding logical laws

Definition RPF-2 (Banach-Tarski Hypostatic Decomposition):

HypostaticDecomposition(2) ≡def 2 ⊞ F₂ = {0, 2′} where:

- 0 = retained full divinity

- 2′ = assumed full human nature (incarnate component)

The Son decomposes via B∘P operator capacity for ontological restructuring within MESH domains

Definition RPF-3 (Resurrection Operator Cycle):

ResurrectionCycle(2′) ≡def SU(2) action where:

- i⁰ × 2′ = 2′ (incarnation: original state)

- i² × 2′ = -2′ (death: ontological inversion/negation)

- i⁴ × 2′ = 2′ (resurrection: return to original state via cycle completion)

Modal/ontological phase transitions follow SU(2) rotation group with period 4

Core Lemmas

Lemma RPF-L1 (SU(2) Periodicity Implies Return):

□(∀x(i⁴ = 1 → (i² × x = -x → i⁴ × (-x) = x)))

The SU(2) group action has period 4, so any state transformed by i² must return to identity after further i² transformation

Lemma RPF-L2 (Banach-Tarski Enables Paradoxical Duality):

□(2 ⊞ F₂ = {0, 2′} ∧ ¬Contradiction(0, 2′))

The decomposition allows dual natures without violating Non-Contradiction, consistent with Chalcedonian definition

Lemma RPF-L3 (MESH Coherence Requires Cycle Completion):

□(3PDN_MESH_Framework → ¬BruteTermination(2′))

Cross-domain MESH coherence requirements forbid brute termination of essential components

Core Theorem

Theorem RPF-1 (Metaphysical Necessity of Resurrection):

Given:

1. 2 ⊞ F₂ = {0, 2′} (Hypostatic decomposition within MESH)

2. i² × 2′ = -2′ ∧ i⁴ × 2′ = 2′ (SU(2) cycle transitions)

3. 3PDN requires metaphysical completeness and MESH coherence

Therefore: □R (Resurrection is metaphysically necessary for MESH coherence)

Proof Sketch:

Incarnation establishes dual presence {0, 2′} across MESH domains

Death corresponds to i² state (-2′) affecting human component

Mathematical structure of SU(2) operator necessitates return to i⁰ state (2′)

MESH coherence principles mandate cycle completion across domains

No rival framework provides consistent decomposition and reconstitution ∎

Empirical Anchor

Physical Evidence (Shroud of Turin):

H = {H₁, H₂, H₃, H₄} = Shroud observations displaying:

- Superficial, negative, 3D-encoded image

- Characteristics consistent with brief, intense radiation burst

- Currently inexplicable by known natural or artificial means

Bayesian Validation:

P(Resurrection_Model | Shroud_Evidence) >> P(¬Resurrection_Model | Shroud_Evidence)

Shroud evidence provides high-probability posterior support for resurrection model

¬(n₁ = n₂) ∧ ¬Confused(n₁,n₂) ∧

¬Changed(n₁) ∧ ¬Changed(n₂) ∧

¬Divided(p) ∧ ¬Separated(n₁,n₂)

Hypostatic Union exists when one person has two distinct natures without confusion, change, division, or separation

Definition HUF-2 (Nature Integrity):

NatureIntegrity(n) ≡def ∀p(N(p,n) → (Complete(p,n) ∧ Authentic(p,n) ∧ Uncompromised(p,n)))

Nature integrity means that when a person has a nature, that nature is complete, authentic, and uncompromised

Definition HUF-3 (Chalcedonian Constraints):

Chalcedonian(p,n₁,n₂) ≡def HypostaticUnion(p,n₁,n₂) ∧

¬Confusion(n₁,n₂) ∧     // natures remain distinct

¬Change(n₁,n₂) ∧        // natures unchanged

¬Division(p) ∧          // person undivided

¬Separation(n₁,n₂)      // natures not separated

Chalcedonian constraints ensure proper dual-nature unity without violating nature integrity

Axioms

Axiom HUF-1 (Nature Distinctness):

□(∀n₁,n₂(Divine(n₁) ∧ Human(n₂) → n₁ ≠ n₂))

Necessarily, divine and human natures are distinct

Axiom HUF-2 (Union Coherence):

□(∀p,n₁,n₂(HypostaticUnion(p,n₁,n₂) → (NatureIntegrity(n₁) ∧ NatureIntegrity(n₂))))

Necessarily, hypostatic union preserves the integrity of both natures

Axiom HUF-3 (Personal Unity):

□(∀p,n₁,n₂(HypostaticUnion(p,n₁,n₂) → ∃!identity(PersonalIdentity(p,identity))))

Necessarily, hypostatic union maintains single personal identity

Core Theorems

Theorem HUF-1: ∀p,n₁,n₂(Divine(n₁) ∧ Human(n₂) ∧ HypostaticUnion(p,n₁,n₂) → ¬Contradiction(p)) (Divine-human union creates no logical contradiction)

Proof:

Suppose HypostaticUnion(p,Divine_n,Human_n) [assumption]

HypostaticUnion → ¬Confusion(Divine_n,Human_n) [Definition HUF-3]

¬Confusion → Properties maintained separately in each nature [logical consequence]

Separate property maintenance → No contradiction within either nature

Single person p unites without logical contradiction

Therefore ¬Contradiction(p) ∎

Theorem HUF-2: ∀p(God(p) ∧ Human(p) → ∃n₁,n₂(Divine(n₁) ∧ Human(n₂) ∧ HypostaticUnion(p,n₁,n₂))) (If someone is both God and human, they must have hypostatic union)

Proof:

Suppose God(p) ∧ Human(p) [assumption]

God(p) → ∃n₁(Divine(n₁) ∧ N(p,n₁)) [God requires divine nature]

Human(p) → ∃n₂(Human(n₂) ∧ N(p,n₂)) [human requires human nature]

Divine(n₁) ∧ Human(n₂) → n₁ ≠ n₂ [Axiom HUF-1]

P(p) ∧ N(p,n₁) ∧ N(p,n₂) ∧ (n₁ ≠ n₂) → HypostaticUnion(p,n₁,n₂) [Definition HUF-1]

Therefore ∃n₁,n₂(Divine(n₁) ∧ Human(n₂) ∧ HypostaticUnion(p,n₁,n₂)) ∎

Preservation Properties:

Cycle-preserving: Modal transitions maintain hypostatic integrity

Nature-preserving: Dual-nature unity maintained across resurrection cycle

Identity-preserving: Personal identity maintained through both modal transitions and nature unity
